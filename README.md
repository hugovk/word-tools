Tools to do things with words

favibot
-------

`favibot.py` searches Twitter for tweets containing "[X] is my new favourite word". It then takes all those new favourite words, logs them, lowercases them, and adds them to a [list of words on Wordnik](http://www.wordnik.com/lists/twitter-favourites). It then [tweets them](https://twitter.com/favibot) and `favibot.sh` runs on the logged words and makes top 10 lists and [word clouds](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hugovk/sets/72157636928894765/).

It also does the same for "[X] is my new favorite word" and "[X] is my new fave word" so you can see some geographic variation.
